# databootcamp-ufo-sightings
## Project Overview
The assignment is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings.

#### Background
<i>The general public has come a long way since the 1940s and '50s in accepting the concept that life exists in our universe outside of our planet. In fact, it's very much within our current cultural zeitgeist that contact with "aliens" could very much happen within our lifetimes... or, perhaps, information from such interactions exist and are being withheld from the commonfolk. Extra-planetary beings and UFOs (unidentified flying objects) fall into a subject that intersects the dichotomous worlds of science and storytelling, while remaining still largely ungraspable in the vast depths of unknown space.

One thing is certain, though. UFOs have always had a significant presence in folklore, media, discourse, and culture since the ancient Egyptians. With the rapid development of technological tools and understanding of space, we are able to make more sense of the unknown and to categorize the uncategorized. This UFO sightings tracker has the potential to be a hub for extra-terrestrial reportings and a launchpad for future research on UFOs. </i>

#### Purpose
Use the given dataset to create a webpage that contains a filterable table of UFO sightings and witness testimonials.

This project showcases the ability to utilize JavaScript to make HTML webpages more dynamic.

#### Tools & Software
- JavaScript 
  - D3.js
- HTML
- CSS

MULTI (NON-CASE SENSITIVE) FILTER

Search through the database to find witness reports by date, city, state, country, or UFO shape.

## Conclusion
### Drawbacks
- The date range is quite limited. 
- The sighting database table is not searchable by description

### Future Development
- Connect to a larger or live database that is constantly updated with sightings
  - e.g. MongoDB
  - Possibly via webscraper 
- Give users ability to submit UFO sightings
- Fact check database
  - Use a webscraper to cross reference submissions
